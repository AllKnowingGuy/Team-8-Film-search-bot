The guide to use the “what2watch” telegram-bot.

This bot does not have a particular target audience and does not require any specific skills to use it.

Concept topic: this bot allows users to quickly search for a film to watch depending on a user’s preferences and mood, which it will get after a small survey.


Type in “/start” to start the bot. After that you will receive a welcome message. Then the bot will send you a message to tell your age so that it chooses appropriate films. After that a navigation menu will open, below the type field there are 10 different buttons:

“Название” - here you can type in the title of the film or just some words you remember from the title if you already know what you want to watch.

“Жанр” - here you can choose which genre you would like the film to be.

“Страна” - here you can choose the country of origin of the film from the list or type in the other if it is not listed.

“Год” - here you can either type in the particular year or a period of time  of the film release.

“Рейтинг” - here you can type in the minimal rating on IMDb of the film.

“Возраст” - here you should type in your age so that the film would be appropriate for you.

“Ключевые слова” - here you can type in the key words that would describe the film you want to watch.

“Настроение” - here you can type in your current mood to make the search more particular.

“Проверить предпочтения” - this button shows the full list of your chosen preferences.

“Искать” - the search button, it performs a neural network-assisted search for 3 suitable films.

Some devices may not see all ten menu buttons at once. Use the scrolling wheel if necessary. 


The first 8 buttons are responsible for the parameters of a desirable film. Each of 8 searching parameters is optional. For example, you may choose only the genre of the film and your mood and press the search button. In this case the bot will find a film based on these 2 parameters. Having pressed one of the 8 parameter buttons, you can return to the navigation menu with the "Назад" button or clear the wrongly chosen parameter, if there are any, with the "Сбросить ответ" button.

The bot needs time to think (especially after the "Искать" button has been pressed), so do not overload it with commands. Use one of the menu buttons at a time and wait for the bot’s response.
